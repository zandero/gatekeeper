# Check latest Version V2

Version V2 improves on:
- the sun gear arrengment improves closing/opening tourque (opening and closing)
- the gate stays in position even when motors are not powered

## Important
- make sure you align the gears correctly / when misaligned some tooth might skip
- three planetary gears are possible but then the screws for the cover are blocked therefore two planetary gears
- greasing the gears is not necessary but will not hurt
